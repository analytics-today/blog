-- The three main methods used to load data into Snowflake in PROD.
-- These typically load the data from an external stage (cloud storage)
-- into a "landing" table in Snowflake (make the type TRANSIENT) to save storage space
-- The principles are the same for both an internal and external stage.
-- Best advice:  Don't build up terabytes of data to Snowflake to scan.
-- Either remove the files or oganise them into logicla "directories".

-- Slowest method:  Scan entire stage
copy into sales_table
  from @landing_data
  pattern='.*[.]csv';

-- Most Flexible method:  Limit within directory
copy into sales_table
  from @landing_data/sales/transactions/2020/05
  pattern='.*[.]csv';

-- Fastest method:  A named file
copy into sales_table
  from @landing_data/sales/transactions/2020/05/sales_050.csv;

  -- Be aware, the reference to the "slowest" method is relative
  -- In reality Snowflake will terabytes of data per hour.
  -- Just don't let it scan 500 Tb of files on your S3 bucket
  -- to find a 1Mb file.
