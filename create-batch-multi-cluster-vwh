-- This SQL Snippet creates a multi-cluster (scale out) virtual warehouse suitable for batch processing.
-- The SQL snippet below illustrates the command needed to create a multi-cluster warehouse, which will
-- automatically suspend after 60 seconds idle time, but use the ECONOMY scaling policy to favour throughput
-- and saving credits over individual query latency.
--
-- If you have a large batch task (eg. a massive load and transformation task), you will typically find you 
-- have a number of tasks which can be run in parallel, but some are dependent upon the prior steps (ie. run sequentially).
--
-- If you use (for example), Airflow, you could submit multiple parallel connections to Snowflake, all using the same VWH
-- and max out the VWH (which is the most efficient use of resources).  When the VWH is fully loaded queries will be queued
-- until there are sufficient resources to complete the task, unless you configure it to use multi-cluster.
--
-- In this case, Snowflake will create additional (SAME SIZE!!) VWHs provided there's enough work to keep them busy.
-- Currently (August 2020), ECONOMY scaling policy means, if there's enough queries queued to keep a VWH busy for six minutes
-- it will automatically allocate a new cluster, and the suspended queries will start.
-- 
-- When ANY of the clusters are finished (ie. have no further work to do), Snowflake will automatically suspend those clusters,
-- and will re-direct further queries to the remaining running clusters, provided they are not running at 100% capacity.
--
-- This is important, because most people assume "multi-cluster" (scale-out) is simply for lots of end-user queries.
-- But it's also a way to efficiently complete batch operations in the shortest possible time, while also automatically adjusting the
-- VWH size (by adding or suspending clusters).
